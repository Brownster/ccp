# Terraform Cost Estimator - Issues and Solutions

## Identified Issues

### Backend Issues
1. **Fixed**: Indentation issue in `/upload` endpoint causing code execution problems
   - File was not being saved before trying to process it
   - Indentation in the `with zipfile.ZipFile` block was incorrect
   - Duplicate code blocks were present

2. **Fixed**: `/suggest-usage` endpoint contained duplicated and unrelated code
   - Endpoint had code copied from the upload endpoint that didn't belong there
   - LLM response processing was unreachable (after a return statement)

3. **Needs Attention**: Error handling in several endpoints may be inconsistent
   - Some catch blocks may be too generic
   - Temporary files might not be cleaned up in some error conditions

### Frontend Issues
1. **Partially Fixed**: Missing component imports and missing state
   - Added missing `showWizard` state
   - Commented out unavailable component imports with TODO notes

2. **Partially Fixed**: Wizard modal implementation issues
   - Fixed component structure and added button
   - Removed malformed fetch code
   - Modal needs to be imported from the correct path once available

3. **Not Fixed**: Path issues for component imports
   - Component paths need to be verified
   - Import paths need to match project structure

## Component Integration ToDo

1. **UsageWizardModal Integration**
   - Need to ensure the component is correctly imported from the right path
   - Verify if the component should be in `/frontend/components/` or `/frontend/src/components/`

2. **CopilotSidebar Integration**
   - Similar path issues need resolution
   - Component should be imported from the correct location

## Additional Changes Needed

1. **Environment Variables**
   - The frontend hardcodes the API URL as `http://localhost:8000`
   - Should use environment variables consistently (see `.env.example` files mentioned in README)

2. **Usage Assumption Flow**
   - The connection between usage wizard and API needs careful testing
   - Several endpoints overlap in functionality

3. **Testing**
   - Test the fixed code with actual Terraform files
   - Verify that the usage wizard properly modifies the estimations

## Next Steps

1. Verify component paths and uncomment component imports when ready
2. Add proper API URL configuration using environment variables
3. Test the application with sample Terraform files
4. Review and improve error handling throughout the application
